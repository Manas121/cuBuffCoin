This project implements a toy version of a cryptocurrency system called Blockchain. Blockchain is a digital currency handling system where transactions are added to something called "blocks" and the blocks are connected to each other to form a "blockchain". Blockchain contains a list of all the pending transactions for each of the blocks. Blockchain mining is an algorithm that is used to process these transactions.
